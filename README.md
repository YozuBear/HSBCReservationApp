# HSBC Reservation App

I was working as a project manager and handling all the [backend logic](https://github.com/YozuBear/HSBCReservationApp/tree/master/src) for this HSBC desk reservation app, we choseÂ Java and Spring MVC for backend.  <br /><br />
I set up the example communications from frontend (Javascript) to backend for our frontend team, designed the front end layout on paper, created data structures for backend, laid out skeleton code to link with MySQL code, set up email service using Google mail server, uploaded the app onto AWS EC2 Tomcat, and coordinated with the industrial technicians from HSBC.  
<br />
While I was not in charge of the frontend and database management, I was heavily involved in their design and layout.
<br />
The app was on AWS for a year, but I terminated it a few months ago after the free trial ended.
